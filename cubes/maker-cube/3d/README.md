# Maker-Cube 3D Files

You can choose between different formats:

- Fusion 360
- OBJ
- STEP
- STL (contains some exclusive parts)

If you choose Fusion 360, OBJ or STEP, please also have a look at the STL folder. It might contain some parts than are not included in the other folders.

The base-plate is a work-in-progress and contains some holes, which are planned to be used in a later version of the Maker-Cube (for example to contain a power-on/off switch and a USB charging port). Feel free to create your own base plate that fits to the base cube without these holes.
